# Datalogger LPWAN IoT Use Case (PRELIMINARY)

NIST uses datalogger devices to collect environmental measurements
(e.g., temperature) on campus. The devices store measurements locally,
and the measurements are collected periodically.

The LPWAN IoT use case is to connect a fipy device to the datalogger's
serial port and provide an LPWAN service to collect measurements as
they are taken.
